        <b>b2</b> is a booru browser for macOS Big Sur that lets you surf e621,
        e926, and more. It's designed for macOS, so you get all of the features
        you expect from a native Mac app, like: multiple windows, tabbing, deep
        customization, and great performance. b2 was carefully designed to have
        an intuitive interface that is not only easy to use, but powerful as
        well.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3 id="supported-boorus">Which boorus are supported?</h3>
      <p>The following boorus are currently supported:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>e621 (account required)</li>
        <li>e926</li>
        <li>Hydrus Network</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="why-paid">Why is b2 a paid app?</h3>
      <p>
        b2 has been in development since 2019. While not continuous, I've spent
        countless hours building, polishing, refining, and testing the app. b2
        is also my very first Mac app, so learning the basics (and dark corners)
        of Cocoa took a long time. Extra effort and time was spent in order to
        craft a quality Mac app that follows the
        <a
          href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/"
          >macOS Human Interface Guidelines</a
        >, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        b2 respects your privacy and does not include DRM. I also believe that 6
        USD a very fair price in exchange for the amount of time I've spent
        making the app.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-tech">What technologies does b2 use?</h3>
      <p>
        b2 is written in Swift and uses AppKit. Third party libraries in use
        include GRDB and Path.
      </p>
      <h3 id="why-unsigned">Why is b2 unsigned?/How do I run b2?</h3>
      <p>
        b2 is unsigned because I'm fresh out of high school and unemployed,
        meaning that I'm unable to acquire a Developer ID for application
        signing and notarization.
      </p>
      <p>
        To run b2, ensure that you have "Allow apps downloaded from:" set to
        "App Store and identified developers" in the Security &amp; Privacy pane
        of System Preferences. Then, right click b2 in Finder and click open.
        Close the Gatekeeper dialog, then do it again. b2 should then open.
      </p>
